# Reading material for the second lecture:

```
In week two we will discuss the following topics:
• Intro JavaScript (What is it, where can you use it for)
• Variables [var, let, const]
• Basic Data types [Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans]
• Operators
• Naming conventions
```

## How to get started
1. Download and install the *LTS* version of NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
To test that it was installed and running properly, go to your terminal and run the command: node -v You should get the node version printed on your terminal, for example, v8.9.1
2. Please check the [VSCode Tips](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/tree/master/VSCodeTips/README.md) to ensure that VSCode is installed and configured correctly.

## Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the coming lecture:

Please watch the following parts of the course, [Programming Foundations Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Welcome/83603/90426-4.html) on Lynda.com (if you don't have access to Lynda yet ask Gijs):

Only watch the below chapters:

0. Introduction
1. Programming Basics
2. Core Programming Syntax 
3. Variables and Data Types

- Read this ~ http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html read up to and including the *Strings* chapter (it’s okay if you don’t understand all of it yet, we will cover these concepts in class as well. Do make sure to write or document the questions you have so we can discuss them in class)
