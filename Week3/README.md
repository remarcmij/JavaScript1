# Reading material for the third lecture:

```
In week three we will discuss the following topics:
• Git work flow
• Advanced data types [Objects]
• Conditions
• Statements vs Expressions
• Loops (for/while)
• Functions
```

### Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the coming lecture:

Please watch the following parts of the course, [Programming Foundations Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Welcome/83603/90426-4.html) on Lynda.com (if you don't have access to Lynda yet ask Gijs):
    <br>4. Writing Conditional Code
    <br>5. Modular Code
    <br>6. Iteration: Writing Loops
    <br>7. More About Strings
    <br>8. Collections
    <br>11. When Things Go Wrong 

## Arrays

Read the documentation from MDN about arrays: [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype).

Please go through these chapters of _Eloquent JavaScript_ to prepare for your next class. We don't expect you to understand every detail of it on a first reading.

- [Eloquent JavaScript: Chapter 3 - Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html), up until the _Arrow Functions_ section.

- [Eloquent JavaScript: Chapter 4 - Data Structures: Objects & Arrays](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html). Unless you are really into statistics, you can skip the following sections:

    * _The Lycanthrope's Log_
    * _Computing Correlation_
    * _The final analysis_

    Skip these additional sections for now, as they will be covered in later HYF modules. (You are of course free to read them, but we will not cover them in class):

    * _Rest parameters_
    * _Destructuring_
    * _Exercises_
#### Git work flow
- Check out this video of Daan to see how we use Git Workflow to hand in Homework (from now on): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA
